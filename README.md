My portfolio website includes four main pages plus a landing page. In four main pages, I have photography, web design, illustration and about me. I used Adobe XD to finish my high prototype. Based on the prototype, I developed my web page in visual studio. 
I used icons "hamburger menu""facebook""twitter""instagram""scroll up" from online stylesheet. Reference: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
I used picture tag to create responsive portrait photo on "about" page. All of my images are of high quality.  
I created moving text on "about me" page with animation. I learned the style from a Codepen page. Reference:  https://codepen.io/ChrisDrinkut/pen/GvrqNR. 
Chanllenges: After I validate my css, the result said "Element marquee not allowed as child of element article". So I removed the marquee tag and put h tag/ h2 tag instead. I also leanred that inside article tag, there must be h2 - h6 tag. 
I learned to create hamburger menu by Javascript on w3school.com. Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp
Chanllenges: The hamburger menu can be seen on each viewpoint (mobile, tablet, desktop) when I inspect pages on computer. However, when i test using mobile, the menu icon is gone. It doesn't make sense. But i tried to give it a width and height and it works. 
When creating the mockups for web-design page, I used a royalty-free templet online. Reference: Pixeden.com
