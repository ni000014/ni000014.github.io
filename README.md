My portfolio website includes four main pages plus a landing page. In four main pages, I have photography, web design, illustration and about me. I used Adobe XD to finish my high prototype. Based on the prototype, I developed my web page in visual studio. 
I used icons "hamburger menu""facebook""twitter""instagram""scroll up" from online stylesheet. Referrence: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
I used <picture> to create responsive portrait photo on "about" page 
I learned how to create moving text on "about me" page with animation and marguee tag on Codepen. Referrence:  https://codepen.io/ChrisDrinkut/pen/GvrqNR
I learned to create hamburger menu by Javascript on w3school.com. Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp
When creating the mockups for web-design page, I used a royalty-free templet online. Reference: Pixeden.com
